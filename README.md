# Constraint Satisfaction Problem
Python version of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver.        
A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a problem specified such that a solution is an assignment of values to variables that is valid given constraints on the assignment and the variables’ domains. CSPs are very powerful because a single unchanging set of algorithms can be used to solve any problem specified as a CSP, and many problems can be intuitively specified as CSPs.       
Using implemented CSP solver solves Eight Queens Puzzle problem.
